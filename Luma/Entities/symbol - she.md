## 🧠 Interpretation

_autogenerated by Luma_  
‘She’ likely symbolizes the dreamer’s suppressed emotions, particularly those related to nostalgia, sadness, and perhaps a feeling of vulnerability. The jacket represents a shared history or a connection to the past, while her silent gratitude suggests that the dreamer is both offering and receiving comfort, hinting at a desire for understanding and acceptance of these hidden feelings. This figure could represent the dreamer’s own shadow self – the parts of themselves they don't readily admit or acknowledge.
