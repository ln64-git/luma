## 🔍 Overview

> The recurring ‘She’ embodies a potent, unresolved feminine presence, often representing a neglected aspect of the dreamer's own emotional landscape or a past relationship that continues to exert an influence. Her actions – wearing your jacket and her silent gratitude – suggest a desire for recognition and a lingering need for comfort or validation. This figure acts as a mirror reflecting unspoken feelings and perhaps a fear of confronting unresolved emotional baggage.

## 🧠 Interpretation

_autogenerated by Luma_  
‘She’ likely symbolizes the dreamer's suppressed emotions, particularly those related to vulnerability, acceptance, and perhaps a yearning for nurturing. The jacket represents a shared history and a desire to return to a time of comfort and security, while her tears signify the pain associated with holding back these feelings. She could be a manifestation of the dreamer’s own unmet needs or a call to acknowledge and integrate these sensitive aspects of their being.
