## 🧠 Interpretation

_autogenerated by Luma_  
This dream highlights the dreamer's struggle with suppressed emotions or a nascent urge that feels both tempting and dangerous. The 'Don't light it unless you mean it' instruction likely represents internal conflict – a voice of caution versus a desire for immediate action. The subsequent fire symbolizes a release of these emotions, but also the potential for widespread devastation if not handled with careful consideration and a genuine commitment to the outcome.
