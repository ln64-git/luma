## 🧠 Interpretation

_autogenerated by Luma_  
The cathedral itself symbolizes a system of belief, tradition, or social structure that is failing to provide comfort or security. The open space and falling rain represent vulnerability, chaos, and the erosion of established boundaries. The woman’s behavior indicates a rebellion against rigid expectations and a search for genuine acceptance, potentially reflecting the dreamer’s own feelings of being scrutinized or controlled.
