## 🧠 Interpretation

_autogenerated by Luma_  
The cathedral, lacking a roof, signifies a loss of protection, guidance, or spiritual certainty. The rain represents emotional cleansing, but also vulnerability and the erosion of established foundations. The woman’s laughter and rejection of worship suggest a desire for authenticity and freedom from expectations, while the lack of physical support from the dreamer indicates a disconnect between needing and receiving support.
