## 🗃️ Example Memory Notes

### Memory Note

```markdown
---
type: memory
date: 2025-03-04
tags: [surfing, quiet-morning, routine, quotes]
people: [alex]
location: Encinitas, California
summary: Early session with Alex. Clean lines, no one out. Shared fruit, surf, and a quote about patience and the sea.
---
Woke up at 5:40. Alex texted: “Glass.”  
We were in by 6:15. Zero wind, clean swell.  

He said, “The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient.”  
I didn’t respond — just nodded. 
```

### Dream

```markdown
---
type: dream
date: 2025-03-01
mood: neutral
themes: [movement, freedom]
summary: Riding a bike fast through quiet neighborhoods. No cars, just turns. Felt like I knew where I was going.
---
Dreamt I was biking fast through empty streets. Took every corner without slowing down.  

It wasn’t about escape. More like... motion for the sake of it.  
I woke up feeling like I’d just landed.
```

### Person

```markdown
---
type: person
name: Alex Tran
role: Surf buddy
relationship: Met during an early tide. Quiet type, good instincts.
first_met: 2023
last_mention: 2025-03-04
tags: [surfing, quiet, mornings]
---
Alex doesn’t say much, but every time we surf together it feels like a reset.

He’s the one who taught me to read the tide tables in reverse. “Backwards is sometimes clearer,” he said.
